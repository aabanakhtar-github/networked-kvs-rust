# Networked Key-Value Store in Rust

This project implements a networked key-value store (KVS) in **Rust** using **Tokio**. The server allows clients to store, retrieve, and delete key-value pairs over a network.

## Features

- **KVS operations**: Set, get, and delete key-value pairs.
- **Networked**: TCP server with asynchronous handling using Tokio.
- **Concurrency**: Handles multiple clients efficiently.
